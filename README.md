Just checked THe infinte scrolling is a little unresponsive, you may have to scroll 2-3 times depending on the device/browser support.
You can test this scrolling properly by opening n/w tab in dev tools, and turning responsiveness on like this.Works fine on my local Will work on this cross browser compatibitly later.
